In this article, you will learn an overview of HTML5, including a look at some of the new tags now available to designers and developers. If you want to learn how to take advantage of all the new features of HTML5, continue reading this article!

**Let get started!**

HTML5 is the latest edition of HTML or hypertext markup language.

Some pieces of it are not fully supported in every browser, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't start taking advantage of all that it has to offer.

It is comprised of several parts there are new browser API's and features like Drag and Drop, Geolocation, the canvas element, web storage, and more.

## 1. HTML5 doctype.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
This is much shorter than previous versions of HTML, it's also case insensitive. However, it's still a good idea to type the word `DOCTYPE` in all caps to help with backward compatibility with the older browser.

## 2. Header & Footer elements

```html
<header>This is a header</header>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
<footer>This is a footer</footer>
```

Header and footer elements help in labeling the top and bottom of either the entire document, specific sections or both.

## 3. Nav Element

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

Nav element helps us to structure the navigation of our web pages in this case we're using an unordered list to structure our navigation.

## 4. Section Element

Section element just helps us in breaking the specific sections of our website.

## 5. Address Element

```html
<address>
  <a href="#">Click here</a>
</address>
```

Address element is used to wrap various types of addresses.
