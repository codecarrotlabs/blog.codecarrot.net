When you think about SEO, probably the first thing of is your site's position on Google Search Results. Indeed, you may find your website at the lower postition than expected. However, it’s not the only thing you should focus on.

Nowadays more important than ever and it is necessary for every webmaster to understand the true meaning of SEO.

A big potential for [improving SEO](/12-seo-tips-improve-website-performance-drive-traffic/) is hidden in your code. Taking care of its quality can bring measurable results for website accessibility and result in driving more traffic to your app.

## Importance of SEO

Imagine you’ve build an application spending a huge amount of time and money, but still not many users notice it. This may be the result of a low position on browser searches on Google. In fact, there are more than **3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year**.

It creates an enormous business potential for every busienss, but you need to know how to leverage the power of Search results. Increasing your position in browser searches with SEO and SEM can be a good solution for the above described problem.

## What is SEO

<blockquote>
  the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine’s unpaid results.
</blockquote>

Alright, let’s translate that to English.

SEO _(a.k.a Search engine optimization)_ is a marketing technique focused on growing visibility in organic (non-paid) search engine results. SEO can help you increase organic traffic on your website and improve revenue by reaching out to more people.

Many businesses struggle with specifying who should be accountable for SEO. I’ve often encountered the approach where all those responsibilities are put on the content team, underestimating the developers’ role in achieving favorable results. It can be a deleterious strategy.

As Mozilla defined, SEO consists of not only creative elements but also a lot of technical aspects that improve rankings, drive traffic, and increase awareness in search engines.

Your developers have a huge influence over SEO. Moreover, your dev team’s wrong doings might cause an absolute failure of your SEO activities, so keep them focused on SEO.

## What affects your SEO

First things first. SEO cannot help you if you don’t have good content. The content you put on your website needs to be relevant from your visitor's point of view. When your web app connects reads and authors, the content should be focused around reading, writing etc.

It’s also recommended to make your content keyword-rich, but don’t exaggerate. Google crawlers matter, but at the end of the day you write for human-beings not machines.

Along with the content, you should also keep your eye on the technical stuff. [Things like the title attribute, alt attribute for images, subpages naming, domain and many more are important](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en). 

Browsers will search for your web app and then qualify it based on the mentioned factors. Google counts [more than 200 ranking factors](/google-ranking-factors) before showing the search results.

## How developers can impact SEO?

As mentioned before, developers have a significant role in impacting the SEO. Firstly, they can substantially improve your position on the Search Engine Result Page (SERP), but also their mistakes in crucial areas may affect all efforts of the content team.

In order to avoid such scenario, you can take advantage of the tools such as [Google’s PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) that enable you to both measure your website condition from the search engine’s perspective and help optimise different variables to improve app performance.

Here's a bunch of ranking factors, check the [full list here](/google-ranking-factors).

* Improving the speed of an application
* High quality of your code can prevent the vast majority of bugs and app crashes
* Use proper tags like title attribute, alt attribute for images, subpages naming, alt attributes on images and CSS classes instead of inline styles
* Implement an SSL certificate
* Using [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) for structured results on Google

## Wrap-up

Developers are important in fulfilling your SEO strategy and they should be involved in planning, execution and analysis of your web app accessibility through search engines.

Keep in mind that building a position in search engines is a complex process and it can take time before it brings results. But don’t get discouraged. When you combine a great content team with support from developers and incorporate SEO in regular activities, there is a sweet fruit at the destination of every strategy.
