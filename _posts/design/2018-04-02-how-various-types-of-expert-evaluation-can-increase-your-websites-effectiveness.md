Keeping your website in good shape is not an easy task, even if you are an expert in that field. You may know the reasons and solutions for the problems that your website is facing, but it can be a tricky job if you are torn between dozens of everyday duties like meetings, company management, and legal issues.

Besides, website maintenance and improvement can be very expensive, and maybe your current position doesn’t allow you that kind of investment. Or maybe you would prefer to invest those assets into something that will be more beneficial to your organisation. Expert evaluations prove to be very useful in these kinds of situations. They are easy, quick, cheap, and, above everything else, they can help you fix your website problems.

## Heuristic Evaluation

This is a [usability engineering method](https://medium.com/@mittalyashu/what-is-heuristic-evaluation-291917865f4e) that tests website usability.

It is recommended for the site to be tested by an experienced UX expert so that you have a professional perspective at the end of the evaluation. This method will deliver you a clear picture of your product’s shortcomings.

If money is an issue, heuristic evaluation can be done by some of your employees using an informal method of reviewing, called heuristic markup. In this method, someone will spend a couple of hours going through the product and doing a set of tasks, just like users would do. This will give you a full close-up of all the weaknesses of your product.

The major advantages of heuristic evaluation are that **it doesn’t require extensive involvement**, and that it **can be used in all phases of the product development**, giving you useful guidelines to improve your website and provide a much more friendly experience to its users.

## Cognitive Walkthrough

This task-specific approach is made to check product usability. It was designed to test whether new users can handle the interface and easily complete wanted tasks. This is **a very cost-effective and fast approach compared to the other usability tests**, and it checks product functionality in practice. You can become aware the usability of the product before investing large amounts of money into something that doesn’t work.

The whole process starts by defining the tasks that the user would normally do, and then goes on to the examination of their usability. In other words, tasks are divided into smaller steps. The login process on a website might look like this:

- Open browser
- Navigate to site
- Click login button
- Enter the username in the username field
- Enter the password in the password field
- Click the login button

A cognitive walkthrough should let you know whether the product is intuitive enough for regular users, will they achieve what they want, are the needed actions available, etc.

The good thing about this process is that **can be carried out by anyone**, and that it can help you prioritize the problems that need solving. It gives you the user’s perspective and, most importantly, fast feedback.

## Conversion-oriented Evaluation

By definition, a conversion rate is the percentage of users who take a desired action – for instance, the percentage of users who purchased something on a website. But conversions can also refer to other actions, such as registrations on a website, or signing up for a subscription. There are also microconversions, which are actions like clicking on a certain link or watching a video. From the perspective of UX analytics, **microconversions can provide valuable information concerning web page design**. An increase of microconversion rates is a clear indicator of a design improvement.

In order for you to make a [conversion evaluation that will have a real impact on your product](/10-tips-to-make-your-users-engaged-till-they-pay-on-your-website), you should first know what your product goal is. With that in your mind, it will be much easier to use the conversion measurement results in a proper way, and focus on the things that will be beneficial. For example, a website may be focused on selling products and solutions, but also on building up a partnership network – this is where understanding what the split between these two is becomes crucial for the person doing the evaluation.

Is it useful, is it professional? And most importantly, what are its weaknesses and inconsistencies and what are its strengths?
