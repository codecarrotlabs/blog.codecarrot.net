[Marketing strategies](/how-to-become-a-digital-marketing-expert-through-blogging), techniques, trends and methods have changed rapidly and for the better over years. These changes have expanded the horizon of inventions in this space and has strengthened the customer-brand relationship.

While deriving the term ‘marketing’ from a Latin word ‘ mercatus’ nobody knew that this strategy would be so important for every brand as it is today. Dating back to the1900s, promotions happened mainly in form of pamphlets, display and announcements. These methods were used to create awareness about particular events happening in towns or for introduction of new commercial goods like fruits, vegetables, beauty products and so on. Marketing can be divided into several types but if broadly classified it is mainly of two types – Outbound and Inbound.

## What is Outbound Marketing?

If observed closely it includes all forms of traditional tactics namely; print ads, television, radio, newspaper, trade shows or exhibitions, direct mails amongst others. Analytics project the efficiency of outbound marketing to be limited to certain set of audiences and is not technologically savvy. Here a lot of assumptions are relied on.

* Audience are based on a wide spectrum of profiling. Thus X amount of money spent here, doesn’t boost conversions as expected or to the mark.
* As outbound is mainly traditional, it doesn’t include the new forms of technology platforms like social media, digital, mobile and so on into its radar. Hence, leaving behind a major chunk of audience who undoubtedly are the future.

## What is Inbound Marketing?

Inbound marketing also largely known as content marketing involves everything that ‘outbound’ effortlessly looks over –

* [Email](/beginners-guide-to-starting-an-email-list)
* [Webinars](/how-to-turn-your-webinar-into-a-magnet-for-new-customers)
* Infographics

It rightly focuses on the new age media and promotion mediums where the profiled audience spend most of their time today. Unlike outbound, it doesn’t ask for attention aggressively. It is carefully segmented and targeted. It awaits to be found by its audience to offer valuable inputs and insights in exchange. In simple words, it is a source of free traffic.

## Benefits
