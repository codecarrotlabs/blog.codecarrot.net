Have you ever tried eating a dosa with different chutneys? You may like one chutney more than the other. Ever thought of applying this dosa-chutney scenario to your website? A/B testing is just that. Applying this to your website, online store or any other landing page/social media ad can help you get more traffic and achieve great conversion rates.

## Understanding A/B testing

Did you know you are probably being A/B tested on every fourth website you visit in a day? Social media websites like Facebook do that too!

The basic concept of A/B testing is to make different iterations of an online element and choose which iteration is doing better than the other. It may be something as big as a landing page or just something as minor as a call-to-action button.

Who doesn’t like options, right! You can test absolutely anything: a form or the placement of it, the amount of text, buttons, icons, design or just the URL structure. You can also test copies for social media and Google ads!

**Check out this A/B testing example:**

From the above image, it is clear that **Version A** had 23% lower Control as compare to **Version B**.

## Why should you do A/B testing

A/B testing can do several things for your online store or website. Here are just a few pointers on why you should consider testing your options:

* **Better customer engagement:** Testing different versions can help gauge your customers’ engagement and keep them on your website longer
* **Improve traffic and conversion rates:** Research showed that A/B testing a website improved conversion rates by at least 15%.
* **Reduce cart abandonment:** Performing an A/B test can help reduce dropoffs from your website and retain your customers. Testing a different version can also help you significantly reduce your bounce rates.
* **Cut out junk leads:** Examples show A/B tests that had longer steps involved, attracted quality leads.
* **Test anything:** You can test absolutely anything – right from a high-risk project to a simple button – without having to forego on customers or scare them away with drastic changes.
* **Save money:** Testing versions can help you reduce costs and save on your budget.
* **Analyse easily:** Analysing your A/B tests are easy with online tools. Your results are measurable in numbers and percentages that can help you decide which version is doing better.

## How to do A/B testing

There are several tools that you can perform A/B tests with. Most of them require a bit of code-embedding and it’s not difficult. Here are a few easy tools that can help you start testing on your website immediately:

### 1. Google Analytics

If you are familiar with Google Analytics, you can easily perform A/B tests. Google offers something called “Content Experiment” that allows you to perform split tests and multi-page tests as well. [Check out this guide to testing with Google Analytics](/step-by-step-guide-to-ab-testing-with-google-analytics).

### 2. Five-Second Test

This is a tool that allows you to upload your design and run a five-second test on your users. Almost like a memory game, your customers will be shown a certain page and a word cloud after five seconds and will be asked to choose what they register or remember about the page they just saw. [Try the tool here](//fivesecondtest.com).

### 3. Optimizely

In this tool, all you need to do is copy the embed code for tracking different goals of your website and paste it into your website’s HTML code. [Here’s an easy guide to start using Optimizely](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJnpNgd-UdY).

Don’t have a website yet? Don't worry, you can [get with CodeCarrot](//www.codecarrot.net). You can not only track who visits your website but also get detailed insights and test with the Google Analytics app. **Sell your products/services** directly from your website, **accept payments** and lot more.
